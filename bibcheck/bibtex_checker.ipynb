    "- ~~handle first-author surnames that start with lowercase characters~~\n",
    "- ~~better handling of curly braces to preserve name ordering~~\n",
    "- ~~better handling of escape characters~~\n",
    "- ~~ensure bibtex file compiles and gets parsed correctly~~\n",
    "- ~~Check duplicate titles/authors (fail if detected)~~\n",
    "- ~~Check bibtex keys.  Duplicates should be assigned a suffix of 'a', 'b', etc.~~\n",
    "- ~~If keys match aside from suffix then still allow the bibtex file to \"pass\" as long as all \"matching\" keys are unique *and* all have suffixes *and* the suffixes span a, b, c, ..., etc. without gaps~~\n",
    "~~- Correct page numberings:~~\n",
    "  ~~- Change hyphens to n-dashes~~~~\n",
    "  ~~- Change m-dashes to n-dashes~~\n",
    "  ~~- Remove spaces in page ranges~~\n",
    "  ~~- Print a warning for strangely formatted pages: leading 0, non-digits, very large numbers (greater than 10K?) but allow bibtex file to pass~~\n",
    "- ~~remove everything except for \"keep_fields\"~~\n",
    "  - ~~Also add a \"force\" field that, when present, causes the checker to automatically pass that entry (if set to True); this will be used as a workaround for special cases not handled by the parser/checker~~\n",
    "- ~~change all urls, dois, and page numbers to lowercase~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean up:\n",
    "- ~~correct all \"strings\" to full journal names~~\n",
    "- ~~correct capitalization of journal names~~\n",
    "- ~~correct all journal abbreviations to full journal names~~\n",
    "- ~~Ensure no periods in journal names~~\n",
    "- ~~Ensure no periods at the ends of affiliations or titles~~\n",
    "- ~~Check for compressed initials (AA --> A A; A.A. --> A A; etc.)~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus:\n",
    "- Use scholarly to verify information.  However, this is currently unreliable (server seems to hang frequently) and too slow to be viable"
